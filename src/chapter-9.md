* **Being vulnerable and authentic:** Being open and honest about our struggles and challenges can help us connect with others on a deeper level, and foster feelings of empathy and understanding.

* **Practicing active listening:** Practicing active listening skills, such as asking questions and reflecting back what we have heard, can help us build stronger connections and show others that we care.

Navigating difficult relationships and setting boundaries

Navigating difficult relationships and setting boundaries is an important part of building healthy, supportive networks. Some strategies for doing this include:
